Which would you say best describes your primary role?,"So that we can better understand your experience with software engineering artifacts, roughly how many publications have you authored?","For the purposes of this questionnaire, we define an artifact as any external materials or information provided in conjunction with a research paper.  In practice, this consists of any materials developed by authors and linked to from a research paper. For example, this would include replication packages, tools/source code, companion sites, benchmarks, raw data, survey instruments and results, mechanized proofs, and more.

Have you ever published a paper that included an artifact?",Consider your most recently published paper in which you shared an artifact.
