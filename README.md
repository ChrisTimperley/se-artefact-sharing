## Contents

Below is a description of the contents of this repository:

* `survey-questionnaire.pdf`: outlines the questionnaire that was given to
  participants and describes the branching logic that was used to target
  specific subpopulations (e.g., past AEC members).
* `recruitment-email.pdf`: provides the recruitment email that was sent to 744
  validated participants, all of whom had published at least one technical-track
  paper at ICSE, FSE, ASE, or EMSE in 2018.
* `consent-form.pdf`: provides the form that was used by participants to
  give their consent for the investigators to use their responses as part of the
  study.


Note that, due to the risk of reidentification, we do not provide our survey data
as part of our replication package.
